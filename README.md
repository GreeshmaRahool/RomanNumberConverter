# Arabic - Roman Converter

The project demonstrates arabic-roman converters.

The Romans wrote numbers using letters - I, V, X, L, C, D, M.

 1  => I 
 
 10  => X 
 
 7  => VII



There is no need to convert numbers larger than 3000.
 
 Consider the example of 1989.

In Roman numerals 1989 is MCMLXXXIX:

1000=M 900=CM 90=LXXX 9=IX
